# Statistics-and-Machine-Learning
Solutions to real time problems using machine learning. This repository shows the implementation of machine learning algorithms to predict/classify various things from basic level.

1)Houseprices is a solution to one of the questions in hackerRank under Artificial Intelligence. 
Link to question : https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/predicting-house-prices/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen 

2)Intel image classification is a kaggle problem. Dataset consists of natural scenes around the world.
  Images need to be classified into 6 categories: Mountain, Street, Sea, Glacier, forest and Buildings. I have trained the model using CNN to classify the images.
  I have used keras library to design the layers of CNN. CNN model I have written consists of 2 sets of convolution layer and max pool layer. In the end, 3 fully connected layers are put. 
  

3)Cats_vs_dogs is another kaggle problem to identify cats and dogs. A basic dataset for which I have implemented another CNN model to classify.
